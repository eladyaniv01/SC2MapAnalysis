Getting Started
===============

Installation
############

**HAAAAAUyou will need to have** `64 bit python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ **installed**


Download and Install
--------------------

*Inside* your bots virtual environment,

clone the repo into its own directory,

somewhere outside your bot folders:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/eladyaniv01/SC2MapAnalysis.git

    cd SC2MapAnalysis

And then:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install .


- or if you want to contribute, or run tests locally

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .[dev]


- or just with

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt


.. rst-class:: bignums

Folder Structure
----------------

All that is left now, is to grab the ``MapAnalyzer`` folder, and place it in your bot root directory

Roughly like so:

| MyBot
| ├── MapAnalyzer
| │   ├── ... dependencies for MapAnalyzer
| │   ├── ...
| │ ... your bot files and folders here


In the folder structure above:

- ``MyBot`` is the folder of your bot
- ``MapAnalyzer`` is the directory from this repo (MapAnalyzer dir) that you have unpacked in your bot root
